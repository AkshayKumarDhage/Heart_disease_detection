Libraries: Sklearn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.
Web framework: Flask web framework in Python
Deployment: Heroku

Files introduction for this repository,
1. heart.csv is the dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. model.py is the python script in which Machine Learning Model is developed.
3. knn_model.py is saved ML model after training it on the available dataset.
4. app.py has all the code used in developing web application for hosting this Machine Model as a service. This is developed using Flask      web framework.
